# KSP-IVA-modding-Guide
A complete guide on how to make and modify IVAs for Kerbal Space Program.  
<br/>
Information on KSP IVA modding tend to be scarse, or old, so this is an attempt at making a centralized place for that, with all my experience and others's I could find, put together.  
<br/>
__The actual guide is in the Wiki :__ https://github.com/kurgut/KSP-IVA-modding-Guide/wiki  
<br/>
There is also a KSP forum thread, for discussions and questions : [to come]  
Alternatively, you can join my KSP discord server and ask your questions there : https://discord.gg/GcfDk4DYHU
