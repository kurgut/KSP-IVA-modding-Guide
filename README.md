# KSP IVA modding Guide
A complete guide on how to make and modify IVAs for Kerbal Space Program.  
<br/>
Information on KSP IVA modding tend to be scarse, or old, so this is an attempt at making a centralized place for that, with all my experience and others's I could find, put together.  
<br/>
<br/>
__The actual guide is in the Wiki :__ https://github.com/kurgut/KSP-IVA-modding-Guide/wiki  
<br/>
<br/>
If you see mistakes, errors / other, or have suggestions or additions for this wiki, feel free to create an issue on the repo üëç or pull requests, I'm not sure how wiki contributing works actually.  
<br/>
There is also a KSP forum thread, for discussions, suggestions and questions : [__Complete IVA modding guide : modifying, creating - Unity, Blender__](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/226469-complete-iva-modding-guide-modifying-creating-unity-blender/)  
Alternatively, you can join my KSP discord server and ask your questions there : https://discord.gg/GcfDk4DYHU  
<br/>
Happy IVA modding !
