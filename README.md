# KSP IVA modding Guide
A complete guide on how to make and modify IVAs for Kerbal Space Program.  
<br/>
Information on KSP IVA modding tend to be scarse, or old, so this is an attempt at making a centralized place for that, with all my experience and others's I could find, put together.  
<br/>
<br/>
__--> The actual guide is in the Wiki :__ https://github.com/kurgut/KSP-IVA-modding-Guide/wiki  
<br/>
<br/>
If you have a suggestion, for changes, errors / mistakes, or additions to the IVA modding Wiki, feel free to write about it in the [__Discussions__](https://github.com/kurgut/KSP-IVA-modding-Guide/discussions) section > [__Wiki-feedback channel__](https://github.com/kurgut/KSP-IVA-modding-Guide/discussions/categories/wiki-feedback)  
There is also a KSP forum thread, for discussions, suggestions and questions : [__Complete IVA modding guide : modifying, creating - Unity, Blender__](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/226469-complete-iva-modding-guide-modifying-creating-unity-blender/)
