# KSP-IVA-modding-Guide
A somewhat complete guide on how to make and modify IVAs for Kerbal Space Program.  
<br/>
Information on KSP IVA modding tend to be scarse, or old, so this is an attempt at making a centralized place for that, with all my experience and others's I could find, put together.  
The actual guide is in the Wiki : https://github.com/kurgut/KSP-IVA-modding-Guide/wiki
